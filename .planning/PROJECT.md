# AnimeHeaven (Crunchyroll Downloader)

## What This Is

A CLI tool written in Go that downloads anime episodes from Crunchyroll, decrypts Widevine DRM, and remuxes video + multi-audio + multi-subtitle tracks into MKV files. Now with proper error handling, configurable output, disk-efficient streaming, and CI-backed testing.

## Core Value

Download any anime episode or full season from Crunchyroll into a single playable MKV file with chosen audio and subtitle tracks.

## Current Milestone: v1.1 Storage, CLI & Error Handling

**Goal:** Reduce storage footprint, modernize CLI with Bubble Tea, and harden download error handling.

**Target features:**
- Storage optimization via compression (research best quality/size trade-offs)
- Bubble Tea TUI for interactive CLI experience
- Graceful error handling for missing audio/subtitle tracks
- Organized download output structure
- Metadata injection into anime folders
- Structured strategic logging for bug/error identification

### Active

- [ ] Resumable downloads — track completed segments in a `.part` state file
- [ ] Concurrent episode downloads within a season
- [ ] Interactive config wizard (`animeheaven setup`)
- [ ] Automatic device ID persistence
- [ ] Download queue with estimated total time
- [ ] Colored terminal output (green ✓ / red ✗ / yellow ⚠)
- [ ] Rate-limit handling (429 responses) with exponential backoff + jitter
- [ ] Disk space check before starting downloads
- [ ] Coverity scan / stricter coverage targets

### Out of Scope

- Support for other streaming services (Funimation, Netflix) — scope too broad
- GUI or web interface — CLI-only by design
- Mobile app — desktop CLI focused
- Real-time streaming / playback — download-only tool
- Cloud storage integration — local filesystem only

## Context

Shipped v1.0 with 5,525 LOC Go across 6 internal packages + testutil.
Tech stack: Go 1.25, golang.org/x/sync (errgroup), golang.org/x/term, gowidevine v0.1.3, go-mpd.
CI: GitHub Actions with go vet, golangci-lint (6 linters), test with -race, coverage reporting.

Current state: 9 test packages, all passing with -race. Zero panic() calls. RAM reduced from 400MB to ~64KB per episode for large downloads. Phase 6 complete — graceful missing-track handling, configurable PII-redacting slog diagnostics, and config-driven language selection wired into runtime.

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Go 1.25 — no framework migration planned
- **External dep**: FFmpeg required at runtime for muxing (no alternative)
- **External dep**: gowidevine v0.1.3 for Widevine CDM (pre-v1, API stability risk)
- **External dep**: go-mpd pseudo-version for DASH manifest parsing
- **Compatibility**: Must support Linux, macOS, Windows (cross-compiled binary)
- **Backward compat**: CLI flags and behavior must remain backward compatible

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Keep Go stdlib for CLI | No framework dependency, simple flag parsing sufficient | ✓ Good |
| Use `internal/` packages | Already refactored from flat main — good modularity baseline | ✓ Good |
| Keep FFmpeg for muxing | Battle-tested, no Go-native muxer matches MKV support | ✓ Good |
| Return errors instead of panic | Replace all panic() with error returns throughout codebase | ✓ Good |
| Disk-backed segment assembly | Eliminate 400MB RAM buffering per episode | ✓ Good |
| errgroup for parallel audio | Structured concurrency with fail-fast cancellation | ✓ Good |
| Pointer-field Config struct | Explicit-only JSON overrides with clear precedence | ✓ Good |
| output.Global singleton | Mirrors config pattern, no plumbing through signatures | ✓ Good |
| Table-driven stdlib tests only | No testify dependency (D-03 from Phase 5) | ✓ Good |
| CI continue-on-error for lint | Lint issues don't block PR merging | ✓ Good |

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd-transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd-complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
